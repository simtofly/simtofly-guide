## Writing Guidelines

If contributing tutorial content:

### Style
- **Beginner-friendly** — Assume zero prior knowledge
- **Clear explanations** — Explain *why*, not just *how*
- **Verify steps** — Every section needs verification
- **Include troubleshooting** — Common errors and solutions

### Format
- Use Markdown
- Add verification checkboxes: `- [ ]`
- Include expected outputs
- Show complete error messages
- Link between related sections

### Code Blocks
```bash
# Use comments to explain
command --with-flags

# Show expected output
# Output: Success message here
```
