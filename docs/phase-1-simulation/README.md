# Phase 1: Simulation Mastery

Master autonomous drone fundamentals in a safe, virtual environment.

---

## Overview

In Phase 1, you'll learn:

- Setup complete simulation environment
- Understand ArduPilot SITL
- Control drones via command line
- Visualize in Gazebo 3D simulator
- Run your first autonomous mission

**No hardware needed** — everything runs on your computer.
